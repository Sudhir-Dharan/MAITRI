# MAITRI - Autonomous Software Development Platform

The modern software development factory is broken. It's caught in a vicious cycle of technical debt and context switching that throttles innovation and burns out engineers. MAITRI (Multi-Agent Intelligence for Team Reinforcement and Innovation) is an enterprise-grade agentic AI platform built to solve this systemic crisis.

This is not another AI coding assistant. MAITRI is a comprehensive operating system that orchestrates a Multi-Agent System (MAS)â€”a "virtual team" of specialized MITRAs (Modular Intelligent Task-driven Reasoning Agent) - autonomously manage the entire software development lifecycle. From a single high-level business goal, MAITRI can:
* Plan & Design: Have Product and Architect agents generate PRDs and system designs.
* Code & Refactor: Deploy Developer agents to write and refactor high-quality code.
* Test & Secure: Use QA and SecOps agents to ensure quality and security.
* Deploy & Monitor: Allow SRE agents to manage releases and production environments.

All of this is governed through the SAARATHI (Strategic Approval and Audited Reasoning Authority with Thresholded Human Interface) Console, a sophisticated Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) interface that provides the transparency, auditable control, and security that enterprises demand. Welcome to the future of software development.
